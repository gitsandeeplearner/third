	<!-- To start the text from after some space in a paragraph, we use text-indent:100px;
		 To make changes in the last line of the text of paragraph, then we use text-align-last:center/right/left;
		 
		 By default "div" takes full horizontal space. If width is given, then the div will show according to the width, but the horizintal space will still be there. So, float property will free up the unwanted space and will make the second div to come horizontal to the first div.
		 To allign all the div's horizontally(x-axis), we need to give float left/right property to all the div's.

		Now suppose if there are three div's and we give float property to two div's, then the third div will automatically comes horizintally up OR If the data in the both the div's is more than the min-height of two div's then the data will overflow on the third div to whom "float" property is not given. To overcome this issue we use "clear:both/left/right" property to the div whom "float" property is not given(means the third div). Now the third div will not come up horizontally and the other two div's will show their full data. and the third div will show under them. 

		Jin div's ko float:left/right diya hai un ka data niche wale div se overflow ho jayega. Theek karne ke liye clear:both use karte hain. 
		
		NOTE: CLEAR:BOTH WILL ONLY WORK WITH DIV NOT WITH SPAN.
